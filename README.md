## Description

Quick prototype built to use Audius api to stream music, currently supports 1 specific track.
When it comes to the video, it repeats the video played until a certain amount of loops have been looped, then hides the first player and unhides the next player to show a seamless transition as if it's a full video.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
